  <h2> <strong> About Me </strong> </h2>
<p> I started learning HTML and JavaScript as a high school student. After high school and 5 years of college, having still not decided what to major in, I started working with a small construction company. The owner of the company told me one day that he thought that I would be really good at SEO, and challenged me to learn as much as I could about it. After reading several books and researching online, I became very skilled at SEO and was able to help several companies become a leader in their industry by appearing first in search results. </p>
